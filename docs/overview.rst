Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

``pfg-retirement`` is **not** available on `PYPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/>`_.
When it is, though, you'll be able to install with ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pfg-retirement

Requirements
------------
This project uses the  following packages:

* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
* `selenium <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/>`_

They can be installed using pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The project also requires a webdriver, many of which can be installed for free.
The examples used here will ustilize a `Google Chrome <https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads>`_ webdriver.

Above all, this package will be useless if you are not a customer with Principal, since you won't have a consumer account to log into.
